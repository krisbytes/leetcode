## Running Tests in VS Code

### 1. Open the project in VS Code
- Launch VS Code.
- Open the folder where your solution and test files are stored.

### 2. Select a Python interpreter
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).  
- Search for **“Python: Select Interpreter”**.  
- Choose the one from your virtual environment (or system Python).

### 3. Install the Python extension
- Go to Extensions (left sidebar, square icon).  
- Search **Python** (by Microsoft) → install.  
- This enables testing, linting, and debugging features.

### 4. Configure tests
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** → type **“Python: Configure Tests”** → Enter.  
2. Choose a test framework:
   - `pytest` (recommended, simpler)  
   - or `unittest`  
3. VS Code will discover test files automatically (look for files named `test_*.py` or ending with `_test.py`).

### 5. Run the tests
- Click the **Testing icon 🧪** on the left sidebar.  
- You’ll see a list of test files and test cases.  
- Options:
  - Run all tests with the **▶ Run All Tests** button at the top.  
  - Run a single test by clicking the small ▶ next to it.  
  - Debug a test by clicking the **🐞 bug icon** instead of ▶.

## Learnings
### Technical 
- Explored some fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithm problems and how to solve them.
- Improved writing clean, testable Python code.
- Learned both `pytest` and `unittest` for automated testing.
- Practiced setting up and running tests in **VS Code**.

### Personal
- When stuck, go two or three steps back (or restart the whole thing from scratch). Fill the missing gap instead of blaming yourself for not being smart enough.
- Rest and having fun in between solving issues/problems are important.
- There is a thin line between asking for help and being spoonfed information.
